    Currently this is a one man project. And there is not much to see and evaluate at this point.
    But I hope that this will change soon as I'm currently developing the application.

            The concept was designed with security first in mind, meaning that the protection of data is most important.
            If a vulnerability was found an advisory will be published on GitHub in the specific repository.

          <b>During the COVID-19 Pandemic</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the bright sides of the COVID-19 pandemic was the need to #stayathome and finally have the time to work on this side project.

          <b>Start Project on CCCamp19</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea was in my head for some while, but I had lack of motivation so I finally wrote some of my ideas down and started to work on the
          project for some times. As you might experienced your self you always need to start with a new domain first! Mycelium-Network should distributed platform 
          to share things that are lying around at home. To reduce my consumption in general and avoid buying new stuff for every project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often I had the problem that I missed some of the tools for my projects, but running 
          around and asking all my friends for it would have been to easy.
          So I though why not over engineer this problem a bit an build some kind of secure and
          open source solution.
